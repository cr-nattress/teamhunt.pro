# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TeamHunt! This guide outlines the process for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone your fork locally
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch from `master`
3. **Develop**: Make your changes following our coding standards
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests as needed
5. **Commit**: Use conventional commit messages
6. **Pull Request**: Open a PR with a clear description

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for types, camelCase for variables

### Code Style
- Use Prettier for formatting (configured in project)
- Use ESLint for code quality (configured in project)
- Follow functional programming patterns where possible
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for user service
refactor: simplify error handling logic
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic
- Write clear PR descriptions explaining the change
- Link related issues
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:ui      # UI end-to-end tests
pnpm test:api     # API end-to-end tests
pnpm test:unit    # Unit tests
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

## Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **ESLint**: Code linting and best practices
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **lint-staged**: Run linters on staged files only
