## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**: Visitor lands → reads content → clicks CTA → proceeds to signup
2. **Mobile Experience**: All functionality works on viewport widths 320px-768px
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader users can navigate and understand content
4. **Performance**: Page loads quickly on slow connections

### Test Data

- Hero images optimized for different screen densities
- Sample content for testing text overflow and layout edge cases
- Various viewport sizes for responsive testing

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

- **Conversion rate lower than expected** - **Impact**: High - **Mitigation**: A/B testing and iterative copy optimization
- **Page performance on slow devices** - **Impact**: Medium - **Mitigation**: Progressive loading and image optimization

### Assumptions

- Users will respond positively to Typeform-inspired minimalist design
- Single, prominent CTA will outperform multiple options
- Mobile-first design approach will serve desktop users effectively
- Hero section content will be sufficient to communicate value proposition

## Notes

The landing page design should feel modern and trustworthy while avoiding overwhelming visitors with too many options. Focus on one primary action (account creation) with supporting content that builds confidence in the platform.

Consider implementing subtle animations and micro-interactions consistent with the UI/UX playbook to enhance the premium feel without impacting performance.
