- **User Registration**: 1,000+ active users
- **Event Completion Rate**: 80%+ events successfully executed
- **User Engagement**: 70%+ participants attend registered events

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core event CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- User authentication and profile management
- Event registration and participant management
- Basic event discovery and search
- Responsive web application
