# User Story: Event Creation and Management

## Overview

- **ID**: US-0001-create-events
- **Epic**: [EP-0001-v1_vail-winter-quest](../../README.md)
- **Owner**: Backend API Team
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Ready
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Created**: 2024-12-10
- **Last Updated**: 2024-12-10

## Story

**As an** event organizer  
**I want** to create and manage events with essential details  
**So that** I can promote my events and manage participant registrations

## Context

Event organizers need a streamlined way to create events with all necessary information. This includes basic details like title, description, date/time, location, and capacity limits. The system should validate input data and provide clear feedback for any errors.

This is the foundational story for the entire platform - without the ability to create events, no other functionality can exist.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** I am an authenticated organizer **When** I submit valid event details **Then** a new event is created with a unique ID
- [ ] **Given** I am creating an event **When** I provide invalid data **Then** I receive clear validation error messages
- [ ] **Given** I have created an event **When** I view my events list **Then** I can see all events I've created
- [ ] **Given** I am the event owner **When** I update event details **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
- [ ] **Given** I am the event owner **When** I delete an event **Then** the event is removed and no longer accessible

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Event creation API responds within 500ms
- [ ] **Security**: Only authenticated users can create events, only owners can modify
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Event creation form is keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
- [ ] **Usability**: Form validation provides immediate feedback without page refresh

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Database schema implemented
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Security controls implemented
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product owner acceptance

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- User authentication system must be functional
- Database schema for events must be designed
- Basic API infrastructure must be in place

### Downstream Dependencies
- Event discovery and search functionality depends on this
- Event registration system depends on this
- Event management dashboard depends on this

## Design & Research

### User Research
- Event organizers prioritize simplicity in event creation
- Key fields identified: title, description, date/time, location, capacity
- Organizers want immediate feedback on validation errors

### Design Assets
- [Event Creation Form Wireframes](https://figma.com/teamhunt/event-creation)
- [API Response Design](https://figma.com/teamhunt/api-responses)

### Technical Design
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
- PostgreSQL database schema for events table
- Input validation using Joi or similar library

## Tasks Breakdown

- [ ] [TS-0001-api-create-event](./tasks/TS-0001-api-create-event/README.md) - Implement POST /v1/events API endpoint

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Valid event creation with all required fields
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary testing for date ranges, capacity limits, text field lengths
3. **Error Handling**: Invalid data, missing required fields, unauthorized access

### Test Data
- Valid event data with various field combinations
- Invalid data sets for validation testing
- Edge case scenarios (past dates, negative capacity, etc.)

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
- **Data Validation Complexity** - **Impact**: Medium - **Mitigation**: Use established validation library
- **Timezone Handling** - **Impact**: High - **Mitigation**: Store all dates in UTC, handle timezone conversion on frontend

### Assumptions
- Organizers will provide accurate event information
- Basic event fields are sufficient for MVP
- Single timezone support is acceptable for initial release

## Notes

This story focuses on the core server-side functionality for event creation. The frontend implementation will be addressed in a separate story. The API should be designed to support future enhancements like recurring events, multiple dates, and advanced scheduling options.

Key technical decisions:
- Use UUIDs for event IDs to avoid enumeration attacks
- Store dates in UTC to simplify timezone handling
- Implement soft deletes to preserve data integrity
- Use proper HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 422 for validation errors)
