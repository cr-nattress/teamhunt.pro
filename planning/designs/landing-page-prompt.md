🎨 UX Pilot Prompt: Hunt Organizer Landing Page (Desktop + Mobile)

ROLE: You are a senior UX/UI designer tasked with creating high-fidelity landing page designs for the product Hunt Organizer. The designs must follow Typeform’s style principles: minimalist, conversational, whitespace-rich layouts, Aperçu Pro (or Montserrat/Work Sans as fallback), monochrome palette with subtle accents, rounded line icons, authentic illustrations/photography, and soft micro-interactions.

Page Structure
1. Hero Section

Headline: “Create unforgettable scavenger hunts with ease.”

Sub-copy: “Design, share, and play hunts that feel fun, not complicated.”

Primary CTA: Large button → “Create New Hunt.” Rounded corners, high contrast.

Secondary CTA: Text button → “Sign In.”

Imagery: Flat illustration (people with map, magnifying glass) OR authentic photo framed by whitespace.

Interaction: CTA expands slightly on hover; background fades on scroll.

2. Workflow Overview Section

Headline: “How it works.”

Sub-copy: “An end-to-end tool that guides you from idea to play.”

Steps: Four cards, each with icon, title, description:

Create your organization

Design your hunt

Build your teams

Share & play

Style: Rounded line icons, monochrome; clean card layout with generous padding.

3. Trust Section
